# Fourier Series 
Fourier Series Expansion is used for periodic signals to expand them in terms of their harmonics which are sinusoidal and orthogonal to one another .
There are two types of signals 
a) Periodic signals 
x(t+To)=x(t) where To is the time period of one cycle 
b) Non Periodic signals 
For periodic signals we use fourier series and for Non Periodic signals we use fourier transformation .
## Dirichlet condition 
Harmonics frequency = cycles/sec or 1/Time period 
### Conditions 
a) Signal should have finite number of maximum and minimum over the range of time period.

b) Signal should have finite number of discontinuities over the range of time period.

c) Signal should be absolutely integrable over the range of time period .
## Types of fourier series 
a) Trigonometric fourier series

b) Comples exponent fourier series

c) Polar /Harmonic Fourier series
## Trigonometric fourier series
x(t)= avg value of x(t) + cosine terms + sine terms
