# Task-2
## Problem Statement
The problem statement is to make a smart spectacles for the auditorily impaired person that alert the person by glowing the LED at a particular area on the glass of spectacles in stimuli to sound coming from the paricular direction.
## Ideation and Planning
1) We have to make a smart spectacles that have many small microphones embedded in the frame of the spectacles to determine the direction of the sound.
2) Then we can use sensors like ultrasonic sensor and determine the distance of the source of sound by emitting a singnal by sensor in the direction of the sound.
3) Then we can code the microcontroller like Arduino or ESP32 according to the data of distance.
4) We can use LED RGB for the purpose to display different lights for differnet distance values, for example , red for close ditance , orange for moderate distance and green for far distance . 
5) This will not only tell the direction from where the sound is coming but also help the auditorily impaired persons with the extra data of distance of the source.
