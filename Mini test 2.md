# Task 2 - Mini Test 2
## Target Audience

Our target audience are auditorily impaired persons mainly but it can also help the persons who are facing an extreme level of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), in which , persons face a major problem in concentrating their attention , hence these spectacles can help them to visvually know to where to forcus their attention in an environment.

Also , there are different kind of hearing conditions ( partial loss / complete loss ) , this project is kind of an extra accessory for complete loss persons while for partial loss persons it is kind of sufficient for them , in spite of other gadgets and hearing aid , due to cost of other gadgets and hearing aid . As smart spectacles are much cheaper as compared to Hearing aid and other gadgets.

## Hearing Aid 

- The most common gadget in todays era for the auditorily impaired persons are Hearing aid .
- Hearing Aid is better than our Smart spectacles , no doubt , but Hearing Aid can cost the person in lakhs also .
- Here comes the rule of our project , as it can be used by partially auditorily impaired persons in everydays chores and can be an extra accessory for the complete auditorily impaired persons.
- Hearing Aids consist of Microphones , Processors and Amplifiers. MIcrophones collect and sound and this sound is amplified by the Hearing Aid and this amplified sound is perceived by the person.
- They are of 2 types 
    - Analog 
    - Digital
     
### Analog Hearing Aid 

a) In this type of Hearing Aid we have to design the Aid according to the environment ( silent or noisy ).

b) As for the silent one we have to program the Hearing Aid to Amplify the sound much more compared to noisy environment due to their difference of pitch of the sound .

c) Where as for the noisy environment we have to Amplify the sound but not much to avoid the extreme noise .

### Digital Hearing Aid

a) In this type of Hearing Aid the sound signal is converted into a digital form (binary form ).

b) As the data is stored in digital form , it does not need to make different kind of hearing aid for different environments , as we can program the amplifier according to the information collected from the sound and henec receieve the sound at an optimal sound .

Hence , Digital Hearing Aid are more prefered over Analog Hearing Aid due to their smart nature to amplify the sound according to the environment .
